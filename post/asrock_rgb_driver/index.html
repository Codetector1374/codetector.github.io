Recently my friend built a new Threadripper desktop. Although being three years 
late to the game, it is still a huge upgrade from laptop. The only annoying thing
is that the ASRock X399 motherboard we use has some RGB lights that are quite
annoying to say the least. The only way to control them is through this ASRock
application under windows.

# Early Investigation

We first probed around the userspace application to see what it does to communicate with the LEDs. 
It loads some ASRockIODriver dll that exports a function called setRGB. This seems very simple,
before we dive deep into reversing this DLL, we decided to do a quick sanity check by setting a
break point on this function see if it actually gets called. To our suprise, the break point is 
never hit. This is a dead end then. (Glad we didn't spend hours working on this dead code path)

Then we probed futher, we see the application opens a interesting handle to `AsDrv` device. This
looks like some sort of handle to a kernel driver. Then looking at the files it loaded, we see that
it loads this file called `AsrDrv103.sys`. It seems to be a very simple ioctl driver.

# AsrDrv103.sys
A quick look at this file provides some very interesting details. The code seems to read and write 
all the CR registers. My first instinct is why would it ever need to touch any of the CRx registers?
At the beginning of this very large switch statement that controls what memory, register and IO ports
to read/write we found some ASE decryption code used to pre-process the argument.

It turns out that all the operation logic is actually encoded in the user-space application, and it 
passes the value and and address it want's to write through an AES encrypted buffer to the kernel space
so this driver can execute it. However, using AES as the only means of protection is obviously insecure.
For a proof of concept we were able to triple-fault the computer by sending an request to zero CR3.
