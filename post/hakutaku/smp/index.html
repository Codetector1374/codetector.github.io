<p>This is one post in my blog series about developing an Operating System for the <code>x86-64</code> platform in Rust.
I aim to cover a small topic in each post along with some code samples to get you started if you are
also interested in doing such a project. The complete project is on <a href="https://github.com/codetector1374/hakutaku">Github</a></p>
<h1 id="multi-core">Multi-core</h1>
<p>Multi-core often sounds like a scary topic for most hobbyist OS developers. Today
we will tackle this problem together in our Rust OS, Hakutaku.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<h2 id="x86-64-smp-start-up-general-process">X86-64 SMP Start-Up General Process</h2>
<p>In <code>x86-64</code> the system / BIOS selects a processor as the <em>Bootstrap Processor</em>
or BSP, and the rest will be selected as <em>Application Processor</em> or AP. All the
APs will be put into a &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; state until a INIT/SIPI (Start-up IPI) is
received. Without any special operations, all of your code will run on this
processor. In order to enable all the other processors, we need to do a few
things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and identify all the other processors on the system.</li>
<li>Send <code>INIT</code> and <code>SIPI</code> <em>Inter-Processor Interrupts</em> (IPI) to each enabled
processor.</li>
<li>Setup temporary GDT / IDT for the APs to bootstrap into <code>Long Mode</code></li>
<li>Add the APs into the scheduler</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apic--lapic">APIC / LAPIC</h2>
<p>APIC or the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller, is the new mechanism
Intel introduced as part of the Intel Multi-Processor (MP) specification. This
is the new mechanism employed by modern processors to manage interrupts.</p>
<p>The APIC system consists of two main components, the Local APIC (LAPIC) and the
IO APIC. Each logical processor on the system will have its own LAPIC and all
processors on a system will share one single IO APIC. On boot, the IOAPIC should
be configured to pass/emulate the Legacy (8259) PIC&rsquo;s interrupts. For now we will
only be configuring the LAPIC. IOAPIC is relatively complicated, we will leave
it for a later post.</p>
<h3 id="the-local-apic">The Local APIC</h3>
<p>The Local APIC is relatively simple. It consists of three sets of registers,
the Interrupt Command Word (ICW), APIC Local Timer, and Local Vector Table (LVT).
Information on register layout can be found in the Intel Manual (Vol. 3, Section 10.4.1, Table 10-1)</p>
<h4 id="interrupt-command-word-icw">Interrupt Command Word (ICW)</h4>
<p>This is probably the most important register as of waking up all the other cores.
This is the register that you will need to probe in order to send IPIs. The ICW
controls what kind of interrupt it is sending, which vector should it be send to,
and who is the recipient of the
said interrupt.</p>
<h4 id="local-apic-timer">Local APIC Timer</h4>
<p>The Local APIC Timer as the name suggests, is local to each logical processor,
and is capable of operating in one of three modes: One-Shot, Periodic and
TSC-Deadline. In our case, since this timer will be generating the periodic
interrupt for our scheduler on each core, we will be configuring it to the
periodic mode.</p>
<h4 id="local-vector-table">Local Vector Table</h4>
<p>Unlike the Interrupt Vector Table which determines what action to take on each
interrupt vector, the LVT controls what vector / interrupt to invoke when the
specified event is triggered. In our case we will need to configure the Spurious
Interrupt vector and Local Timer Interrupt vector.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-configuration-and-power-interface-acpi">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</h2>
<p>I am sure many of you have heard or have seen this word before. This is a table
that describes the configuration of the hardware that our OS is currently running
on. It includes many information about IO Mapping, IRQ Routing, Processor Topology
and much more.</p>
<p>Although some of the tables in ACPI are quite hard to parse (i.e. <code>DSDT</code> &amp; <code>SSDT</code>),
the <code>MADT</code> table we need right now is rather easy.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-apic-description-table-madt">Multiple APIC Description Table (MADT)</h3>
<p>MADT is a simple table that contains entries describing all the LAPIC and by
association their logical processors. Each entry will have describe the state
that the processor is in as well as its processor ID and LAPIC ID.</p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>To add multi-core capability to Hakutaku, we will need to first locate all the
other logical processors. There are multiple ways of doing this, at the time of
writing, the most reliable and widely used method is to locate and parse the ACPI
tables.</p>
<h2 id="acpi-tables">ACPI Tables</h2>
<p>There are two main ways to locate the ACPI Tables, depending on if you are booting
from BIOS or EFI, the method will vary. On traditional BIOS boot mode, the ACPI
table pointer is loaded in to certain section of the system memory (BIOS / BIOS
shadow area). You can simply search for the string <code>RSD PTR</code> (non-null terminated).
When you find the pointer, you can begin to check its signature and its version
number to determine if you are looking at a ACPI 1.0 (version number 0) or later
ACPI tables.</p>
<p>Follow the <code>RSD PTR</code> you should be able to locate the remaining parts of the table
and find the previously mentioned <code>MADT</code> section to list all the available
processors. Before you proceed further in waking up those processors, you should
always check that they are in a Waiting for SIPI mode. (aka not disabled)</p>
<h2 id="waking-up">Waking Up</h2>
<p>Now comes the interesting part, actually waking up the sleeping cores. To do this
I recommend start with only one AP. This will help you detect problem in the
process.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When you wake up a application processor, it will boot to <code>Real Mode</code>
and have access to only the first 1MB of <strong>Physical</strong> Memory. So you should plan
for that and place some code for the APs to run initially. Here I just have a
halt loop and a output to the POST code hex display (Often on I/O Port 0x80).</p>

.loop:
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">hlt</span>
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">jmp</span> ap_boot.loop
</code></pre></div><p>Note the entry point have to be aligned to 4K and located in the first MiB of
memory.</p>
<p>According to intel manual, the protocol for waking up APs consists of the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send an INIT.</li>
<li>Wait for 10ms.</li>
<li>Send the first SIPI.</li>
<li>Wait for 200uS.</li>
<li>If the processor is still not running, send a second SIPI.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-sipi-interrupt">The SIPI Interrupt</h3>
<p>The SIPI interrupt is a very special one, it kicks off the processor from the
default &ldquo;idling&rdquo; state. Since we need to tell the processor where to begin
execution, the vector field for this interrupt is special.</p>
<p>Instead of specifying a interrupt vector, the value in the vector field is used
to select a 4K frame starting from physical address 0 to begin execution hence
the code needs to be aligned on a 4K boundary below 1 MiB.</p>
