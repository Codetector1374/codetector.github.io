      <description>Recently someone on reddit sent me a TEX Yoda II keyboard. It is certainly an interesting board. Not only it is a 60% which greatly saves desk space, it also integrates a IBM style &amp;ldquo;trackpoint&amp;rdquo; so you can put away your mouse too.
Unfortunately the firmware that came with the board is really boring and lack some features that I think is really needed to make a 60% keyboard work. Such as having layers that can be put into a lock mode, or having my typical caps becomes ESC and also act as a layer trigger so I can have arrow keys overlay onto the h j k l keys.</description>
